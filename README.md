# Furniture World

An E-Commerce website for a furniture company built with reactjs and styled-components. The products are fetched via an external API and they can be filtered or sorted in a no. of ways. I set up the filter functionality using context API and the useReducer hook in react. The site also has a lot of other great features like login/logout provided by auth0, payment handling by stripe & netlify functions, and form handling via formspree.
